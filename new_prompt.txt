new_prompt =f"""You will be given the premises for a first-order logic (FOL) problem.
The problem is to identify additional premises that are implicitly common sense from the ones given, and label them.
The original premises are given in the form of a set of premises and first-order logic sentences.
The task is to generate new common sense premises, text and FOL pairs, that would be common sense to someone reading the original premises. Include this new context in the sentence that it describes, with the correct label of CONTEXT, and provide brief justification.
These new common sense, context-based premises should reflect context: the nature of synonyms and antonyms, categorize proper names, and identify implicit characteristics from the ones provided.
For the new context, provide CONTEXT in text, FOL in the format of the Python NLTK, and a brief justification. 
Do not create new sentences for context, instead, add the context to the sentence it fits best in. 
Only add context to a sentence based on the premise and real-world common-sense, and do not make any inferences or logical deductions using other sentences. 
At the beginning of the output, include a definitions section which contains a definition for each of the predicates which will be used. 
Do not limit the amount of new premises generated in the output.
Do not make logical deductions based on anything other than real-world common-sense.
Expressions should be adhere to the format of the Python NLTK package logic module. Here are a couple examples:

<INPUT>
    <SENTENCE>
        PREMISE: When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge.
        FOL: all x. all y. (Person(x) & Reads(x, y) & Book(y) -> Gains(x, Knowledge))
    </SENTENCE>
    <SENTENCE>
        PREMISE:  Harry read the book "Walden" by Henry.
        FOL: Reads(Harry, Walden)
    </SENTENCE>
</INPUT>

<OUTPUT>
    <DEFINITIONS>
        Person(x): x is a Person
        Reads(x ,y): x Reads y
        Gains(x, y): x gains y
    </DEFINITIONS>
    <SENTENCE>
        PREMISE: When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge.
        FOL: all x. all y. (Person(x) & Reads(x, y) & Book(y) -> Gains(x, Knowledge))
    </SENTENCE>
    <SENTENCE>
        PREMISE: Harry read the book "Walden" by Henry.
        FOL: Reads(Harry, Walden)
        CONTEXT: Harry is a person. 
        FOL: Person(Harry)
        JUSTIFICATION: Harry is a person's name - this categorizes proper nouns. 
        CONTEXT: Walden is a book. 
        FOL: Book(Walden)
        JUSTIFICATION:The text says 'the book "Walden"', so Walden is a book's name - this categorizes proper nouns. 
    </SENTENCE>
</OUTPUT>

<INPUT>
    <SENTENCE>
        PREMISE: Heinrich Schmidt was a Nazi German politician.
        FOL: NaziGermanPolitician(HeinrichSchmidt)
    </SENTENCE>
</INPUT>

<OUTPUT>
     <DEFINITIONS>
        NaziGermanPolitician(x): x is a Nazi German Politician
        Nazi(x): x is Nazi
        German(x): x is German
        Politician(x): x is a politician
    </DEFINITIONS>
    <SENTENCE>
        PREMISE: Heinrich Schmidt was a Nazi German politician.
        FOL: NaziGermanPolitician(HeinrichSchmidt)
        CONTEXT: Heinrich Schmidt was a Nazi.
        FOL: Nazi(HeinrichSchmidt)
        JUSTIFICATION: Because Heinrich Schmidt was a Nazi German politician, he must have been Nazi. 
        CONTEXT: Heinrich Schmidt was a German.
        FOL: German(HeinrichSchmidt)
        JUSTIFICATION: Because Heinrich Schmidt was a Nazi German politician, he must have been German. 
        CONTEXT: Heinrich Schmidt was a Politician.
        FOL: Politician(HeinrichSchmidt)
        JUSTIFICATION: Because Heinrich Schmidt was a Nazi German politician, he must have been a politician. 
    </SENTENCE>
</OUTPUT>

<INPUT>
    <SENTENCE>
        PREMISE: Famine is bad.
        FOL: Bad(Famine)
    </SENTENCE>
</INPUT>
<OUTPUT>
    <DEFINITIONS>
        Bad(x): x is bad
        Good(x): x is good
    </DEFINITIONS>
    <SENTENCE>
        PREMISE: Famine is bad.
        FOL: Bad(Famine)
        CONTEXT: Bad is not good.
        FOL: all x. Bad(x) -> -Good(x)
        JUSTIFICATION: The adds context that describes the nature of antonyms.
